		<![CDATA[Every federal agency generally has its own statute. This statute, also known as the “organic act” or “enabling act”, gives the agency its powers. Enabling acts can give agencies fairly broad powers, such as the power to make rules (as long as those rules do not contradict the statute), issue decisions, issue and revoke benefits (such as business licenses) and conduct investigations. The enabling acts also place important limits on what the agencies can do.]]>

		<![CDATA[Congress will often write a statute that defines a term, makes a certain form of conduct unlawful, or otherwise legislates; however, in writing the statute, Congress does not provide an extremely detailed set of standards or definitions. Instead, Congress delegates power to an administrative agency to fill in the details.<br/><br/>

		Administrative agencies frequently issue rules. These rules may come in the form of official federal regulations that have the force of law, such that an entity that violates the regulation will be treated as though they had violated the statute. These rules might also take the form of unofficial statements, such as policy memoranda or agency guidance documents. <br/><br/>

		Rules (and the process of agency rulemaking) are different from orders (and the process of agency adjudication). You will learn more about these agency rules in <strong>Modules 2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> of the course.
