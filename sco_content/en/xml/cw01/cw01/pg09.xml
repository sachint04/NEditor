		<![CDATA[Procedural rules generally refer to the  steps or processes that an agency must follow when it acts, like whether to  publish a copy of its rule to the public or notify affected parties of its  decision in an area. The <abbr title="Administrative Procedure Act">APA</abbr> does not issue substantive guidelines to the  agencies. Substantive actions of an agency might refer to the actual decisions  that an agency makes, such as whether to require a license to engage in certain  forms of business or whether a business needs to take additional safety measures  in order to comply with the law.
