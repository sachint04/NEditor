	Incidents
	@ randomizeIncidents : if set to "true", will select random Incidents from the Incidents pool. If set to "false", will play the Incidents in a sequence as declared
          @ minIncidentsPerDay : Minimum number of Incidents to be played in each Day
          @ maxIncidentsPerDay : Maximum number of Incidents to be played in each Day
          @ noOfDays : A number greater than 0 or unlimited
          @ dayTimeLimit : Number in minutes a Day should last
          @ extraTime : Number in minutes that is provided as extra time
          @ deferEvents : true or false.
		- If set to "true", then the user will not get a Replay button to Replay the Day. Events that cannot be deferred are lost forever, marked as INCOMPLETE or NOTSTARTED, and those that can be deferred will be deferred automatically
		- If set to "false", then the user will not get the "Defer" button in any of the events and will have to continue with the lost events. 
          @ eventsInterval : The time interval at which the Events need to get triggered
	@ dayStartsAt: Hrs:Mins:Secs AM/PM
	@ replayDay: true or false
		- if set to "true" the user will get a Replay button to Replay the Day. It will present the same event pool presented for that day.
		- if set to "false" the user will not get a replay button at the end of the day.

          WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A DEPENDENCY OF ONE INCIDENT ON ANOTHER INCIDENT. i.e. incident no. 8 is dependent on incident no. 3 to be completed first.
          WOULD THER BE A CASE WHERE SOME OF THE INCIDENTS NEED TO ARRIVE ONLY AFTER A DAY OR 2 OR ON A FIXED DAY (LIKE THE LAST DAY)
